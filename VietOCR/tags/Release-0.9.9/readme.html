<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p><a href="http://vietocr.sourceforge.net">VietOCR</a> 
is a Java GUI frontend for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/">
Tesseract OCR engine</a>, providing character recognition support for TIFF, JPEG, GIF, 
PNG, BMP image formats, and multi-page images. The program has postprocessing 
which helps correct errors regularly encountered in the OCR process, boosting 
the accuracy rate on the result.</p>
<h3>SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</h3>
<p><a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">Java Runtime Environment 6.0</a> 
or later.</p>
<h3>
INSTALLATION</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/downloads/list">Language data 
packs</a> for Tesseract should be decompressed into <tt>tesseract</tt> 
installation folder; the data files, whose names start with ISO6639-3 codes, 
will be placed in the <tt>tessdata</tt> subdirectory. On Linux, however, this 
is different as make install Tesseract will place the resultant 
executable binary and the language data in different directories, <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt> 
and <tt>/usr/local/share/tessdata</tt>, respectively. VietOCR assumes that 
they are in the same directory; therefore, for it to work properly, you may need 
to make a soft link to <tt>tessdata</tt> in the same directory as the tesseract 
executable 
is in, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><tt>ln -s /usr/local/share/tessdata /usr/local/bin/tessdata</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, you can also let VietOCR know the location of <tt>tessdata</tt> 
via the environment variable <tt>TESSDATA_PREFIX</tt>:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><tt>export TESSDATA_PREFIX=/usr/local/share/tessdata</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scanning support is provided via the Windows Image Acquisition Library 
v2.0, which requires Windows XP Service Pack 1 (SP1) or later. To install the 
WIA Library, copy the <tt>wiaaut.dll</tt> file to your <tt>System32</tt> directory 
(usually located at <tt>C:\Windows\System32</tt>) and run 
from the command line:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><tt>regsvr32 C:\Windows\System32\wiaaut.dll</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>
INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
<p>
Tesseract currently can 
only recognize uncompressed TIFF images; however, VietOCR enables recognition of 
other image formats.</p>

<p>To launch the program:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><tt>java -jar VietOCR.jar</tt></p>
</blockquote>

<p><b><u>Note</u></b>: If you encounter out-of-memory exception, run <tt>ocr.bat</tt> script instead of using 
the .jar.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese language data were generated for Times New 
Roman, Arial, Verdana, and Courier New fonts. Therefore, the recognition would 
have better success rate for images having similar font glyphs. OCRing images 
that have font glyphs look different from the supported fonts generally will require
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/wiki/TrainingTesseract">training</a> 
Tesseract to create another language data pack specifically for those typefaces.</p>
<p>Images to be OCRed should be scanned at resolution from at 
least 200 DPI (dot per inch) to 400 DPI in monochrome (black&amp;white) or 
grayscale. Scanning at higher resolutions will not necessarily result in better 
recognition accuracy, which currently can be higher than 97% for Vietnamese, and 
the next release of Tesseract may improve it even further. Even so, the actual 
rates still depend greatly on the quality of the scanned image. The settings for 
scanning are typically 300 DPI and 1 bpp (bit per pixel) black&amp;white or 8 bpp 
grayscale uncompressed TIFF format.</p>
<p>The following information pertains to the OCR process of 
Vietnamese text. The recognition errors involving Vietnamese characters can be classified into three 
categories. Many of the errors are related to the letter cases — for example: 
hOa, nhắC — which can be easily corrected by popular Unicode text editors. Many 
other errors are&nbsp;a result of the OCR process, such as missing diacritical marks, 
wrong letters with similar shape, etc. — huu – hưu, mang – marg, h0a – hoa, la – 
1a, uhìu - nhìn. These can also be easily fixed by Vietnamese spell checker 
programs.</p>

<p>The last category of&nbsp; errors is the most difficult to 
detect because they are semantic errors, which means that the words are valid 
entries in the dictionary but are wrong in the context — e.g., tinh – tình, vân 
– vấn. These errors require the editor to read though and manually correct them 
according to the original image.</p>

<p>Following are instructions on how to correct the OCR errors 
in a speedy and effective way the first two groups of errors using 
<a href="http://vietpad.sourceforge.net/">VietPad</a> text editor. The process 
can be summarized as follows:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li>Group lines. The lines need to be grouped to the paragraph 
	they belong, as being OCRed, each line becomes a separate 1-line paragraph. 
	Use <i>Remove Line Breaks</i> function under <i>Format</i> menu. Note that 
	this operation may not be needed for poems.</li>
 <li>Select <i>Change Case</i>, also under <i>Format</i> menu, 
	and choose <i>Sentence case</i> to correct most of the letter case errors. 
	Locate and fix the rest of remaining letter case errors.</li>
 <li>Correct the misspelled errors using the <i>Spell Check</i>
     under <i>Tool</i> menu.</li>
</ol>

<p>Through the above steps, most of common errors should be eliminated. The 
remaining, semantic errors are few, but it requires a human editor to read though 
and make necessary edits to make the document like the original scanned 
document, and error-free if desired.</p>
