            DESCRIPTION</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=153105">VietOCR.NET</a>
            is a .NET GUI frontend for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/">Tesseract
                OCR engine</a>, providing character recognition support for 
			common image formats,
            and multi-page images. The program has postprocessing which helps correct errors
            regularly encountered in the OCR process, boosting the accuracy rate on the result. 
            The program can also function as a console application, executing from the 
            command line.</p>
		<p>Batch processing is now supported. The program monitors a watch 
		folder for new image files, automatically processes them through the OCR 
		engine, and outputs recognition results to an output folder.</p>

            Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=a5c84275-3b97-4ab7-a40d-3802b2af5fc2&displaylang=en">x86</a>,

        <h3>
            INSTALLATION</h3>
        <p>
            If you do not have authority to install under <tt>C:\Program Files</tt> folder,
            you can specify another folder in Install Installation Folder dialog.</p>
        <p>
            Scanning support is provided via the Windows Image Acquisition Library v2.0, which
            requires Windows XP Service Pack 1 (SP1) or later. To install the WIA Library, copy
            the <tt>wiaaut.dll</tt> file to your <tt>System32</tt> directory (usually located
            at <tt>C:\Windows\System32</tt>) and run from the command line:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                <tt>regsvr32 C:\Windows\System32\wiaaut.dll</tt></p>
        </blockquote>
<p>PDF support is possible via
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ghostscript/">GPL Ghostscript</a>. 
After installation of the library, please ensure the dynamic load library <tt>
gsdll32.dll</tt> is in the search path by 
setting the <tt>PATH</tt> environment variable, as follows for version 8.70 on 
Windows:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><tt>set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\gs\gs8.70\bin</tt></p>
</blockquote>
        <h3>
            INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/downloads/list">Language data packs</a>
            for Tesseract should be decompressed into <tt>tesseract</tt> installation folder;
            the data files, whose names start with ISO6639-3 codes, will be placed in the <tt>tessdata</tt>
            subdirectory. Tesseract currently can only recognize uncompressed TIFF images; however,
            VietOCR.NET enables recognition of other image formats.</p>
		<p>
            The Vietnamese language data were generated for Times New Roman, 
			Arial, Verdana, and Courier New fonts. Therefore, the recognition would have better success rate
            for images having similar font glyphs. OCRing images that have font glyphs look
            different from the supported fonts generally will require <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/wiki/TrainingTesseract">
                training</a> Tesseract to create another language data pack specifically for
            those typefaces.</p>
        <p>
            Images to be OCRed should be scanned at resolution from at least 200 DPI (dot per
            inch) to 400 DPI in monochrome (black&amp;white) or grayscale. Scanning at higher
            resolutions will not necessarily result in better recognition accuracy, which currently
            can be higher than 97% for Vietnamese, and the next release of Tesseract may improve
            it even further. Even so, the actual rates still depend greatly on the quality of
            the scanned image. The typical settings for scanning are 300 DPI and 1 bpp (bit
            per pixel) black&amp;white or 8 bpp grayscale uncompressed TIFF or 
			PNG format.</p>
        <p>
            In addition to the built-in text postprocessing algorithm, you can 
			add your own custom text replacement scheme via a text file named 
			<tt>x.DangAmbigs.txt</tt>, where x is the ISO639-3 language code. The 
			UTF-8-encoded file should contain equal sign-delimited 
			<tt>oldValue=newValue</tt> pairs.</p>
		<p>
            Some built-in tools are provided to merge several images or PDF 
			files into a single one for convenient OCR operations, or to split a 
			PDF file into smaller ones if it is too large, which can cause 
			out-of-memory exceptions.</p>
<h3>POSTPROCESSING</h3>
        <p>
            The recognition
            errors can generally be classified into three categories.
            Many of the errors are related to the letter cases — for example: hOa, nhắC — which
            can be easily corrected by popular Unicode text editors. Many other errors are a
            result of the OCR process, such as missing diacritical marks, wrong letters with
            similar shape, etc. — huu – hưu, mang – marg, h0a – hoa, la – 1a, uhìu - nhìn. These
          can also be easily fixed by spell checker programs. The built-in 
			Postprocessing function can help correct many of the aforementioned 
			errors.</p>
        <p>
            The last category of errors is the most difficult to detect because they are
            semantic errors, which means that the words are valid entries in the dictionary
            but are wrong in the context — e.g., tinh – tình, vân – vấn. These errors require
            the editor to read though and manually correct them according to the original image.</p>
        <p>
            Following are instructions on how to correct the first two 
			categories of 
			OCR errors using <a href="http://vietpad.sourceforge.net/">VietPad</a>
            text editor. The process can be summarized as follows:</p>
        <ol style='margin-top: 0in' start="1" type="1">
            <li>Group lines. The lines need to be grouped to the paragraph they belong, as being
                OCRed, each line becomes a separate 1-line paragraph. Use <i>Remove Line Breaks</i>
                function under <i>Format</i> menu. Note that this operation may not be needed for
                poems.</li>
            <li>Select <i>Change Case</i>, also under <i>Format</i> menu, and choose <i>Sentence
                case</i> to correct most of the letter case errors. Locate and fix the rest of remaining
                letter case errors.</li>
            <li>Correct the misspelled errors using the <i>Spell Check</i> under <i>Tool</i> menu.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Through the above steps, most of common errors should be eliminated. The remaining,
            semantic errors are few, but it requires a human editor to read though and make
            necessary edits to make the document like the original scanned document, and error-free
            if desired.</p>
